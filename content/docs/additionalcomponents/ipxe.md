iPXE is an open-source bootloader that is used to initialize HookOS.

This documentation is still to be written. Until that is done, please have a
look at the [Smee DHCP documentation](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tinkerbell/blob/main/docs/technical/smee/DHCP.md)
for an overview of how iPXE is used in Tinkerbell.
