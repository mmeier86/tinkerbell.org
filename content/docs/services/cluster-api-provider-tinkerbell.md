geekdocDescription: "The Cluster API infrastructure provider implementation for Tinkerbell."

## Overview

[Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) (CAPI) brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to Kubernetes cluster creation, configuration and management.
The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true hybrid deployments of Kubernetes, both on-premises and off.
Tinkerbell has a Cluster API [Infrastructure provider](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/concepts#infrastructure-provider) that allows you to use Tinkerbell as a bare metal provider for CAPI.
